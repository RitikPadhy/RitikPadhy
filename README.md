# Welcome to my GitHub Repository!

Hello! I'm **Ritik Padhy**, and welcome to my GitHub. I come from an Electronics and Communications Engineering background with a minor in Data Science from MIT Manipal, and I’m passionate about building data-driven, analytical, and intelligent systems. This repository reflects my work across data analysis, machine learning, AI-based automation, cloud engineering, and full-stack development. I enjoy exploring end-to-end workflows—collecting and preparing data, performing exploratory analysis, developing predictive models, and engineering scalable backend systems that bring analytical insights into production. GitHub is where I learn, experiment, and document projects that showcase my curiosity, technical growth, and interest in applying data and AI to solve meaningful real-world problems.

## About Me
I use GitHub as a space to build, refine, and share the projects that shape my journey in **data science, machine learning, and software engineering**. My work reflects a mix of academic learning, hands-on experimentation, and real-world engineering experience across analytics platforms, automation tools, and AI-driven systems. I value clean, reproducible code and enjoy breaking down complex problems into practical, well-documented solutions. If you explore my repositories, you’ll find a variety of projects—from analytical notebooks to cloud-based pipelines—each representing something I’ve learned or created along the way.

## Collaboration
I’m always open to collaborating on **data analysis, machine learning, cloud engineering, automation, or AI-driven projects**. If you have an idea, find one of my projects interesting, or want to build something together, feel free to reach out.  I’m always happy to connect, exchange ideas, and contribute to meaningful work.
