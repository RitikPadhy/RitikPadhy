# Welcome to my GitHub Repository!

Hello! I'm **Ritik Padhy**, and welcome to my GitHub. With experience across automation engineering, analytics platforms, and cloud-native applications, I enjoy building systems that combine data, software, and AI to create practical impact. My background in Electronics and Communications with a Data Science specialization has given me a strong grounding in programming, statistical thinking, and machine learning fundamentals. Here, I work on projects that span data analysis, ML experimentation, backend services, and AI-assisted tooling—capturing both my technical growth and my interest in turning complex problems into scalable solutions.

## About Me
I use GitHub to document the ideas, tools, and engineering workflows I explore outside of my professional work. My projects often focus on improving data workflows, experimenting with ML techniques, and designing efficient backend components that support analytics and automation. I enjoy creating well-structured, reproducible solutions and approaching problems with a blend of analytical thinking and software engineering discipline. You’ll find projects ranging from exploratory data studies to cloud-integrated applications, each reflecting something I’ve built, learned, or iterated on.

## Collaboration
I'm always open to working with others who share an interest in **data, analytics, automation, or AI-driven engineering**. Whether it's exploring a dataset, designing an ML workflow, or building a tool end-to-end, I'm happy to contribute and learn collaboratively. If you’d like to discuss an idea or collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out—I’d be glad to connect and build something meaningful together.
