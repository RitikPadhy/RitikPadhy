## Welcome to my GitHub Repository!

Hello! I'm **Ritik Padhy**, and welcome to my GitHub. I hold a background in Electronics and Communications Engineering with a minor in Data Science from MIT Manipal, and I’m deeply passionate about building data-driven and intelligent systems. This space reflects my journey across **data analysis, machine learning, AI-driven automation, cloud engineering, and full-stack development**, where I explore how analytical thinking and engineering come together to create impactful solutions. I enjoy working on end-to-end projects—from extracting and analyzing data to developing predictive models, designing scalable backend systems, and integrating modern AI tools to automate real-world workflows. My GitHub is where I learn, experiment, and share projects that showcase my curiosity, technical growth, and interest in applying data and AI to meaningful problems.

## About Me

Being a student, I consider GitHub as my playground, where I can showcase my projects and share my passion for coding with the world. I believe in the power of collaboration and the incredible things we can achieve by working together. So, if you find any of my projects interesting and would like to collaborate, I'm all ears! Within my repository, you'll find an array of projects I've been working on. These projects are a reflection of my growing skills, knowledge, and the curiosity that drives me. Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to any project that catches your attention. Your insights, suggestions, and contributions are highly appreciated!

## Collaboration

Collaboration is the key to innovation, and I'm always excited to team up with like-minded individuals. If you're interested in collaborating on any project or have an idea you'd like to discuss, don't hesitate to reach out to me. You can contact me by sending an email to ritikp2002@gmail.com.
